/*
    Our new crewmember var crewName = "Wesley"; had only been at sea for var daysSailing = 8; days, but he was already rethinking his decision to become a pirate. All he had done so far was swab the decks = [ "Bridge", "Gun deck", "Main deck", "Quarterdeck" ];, which didn't feel very Pirate-y. It felt like his days were just the same thing over and over again:

    Is it time to var swabTheDecks = function(decks){...};? It looks like I have var decksRemaining = decks.length; to go. The First Mate says I have to keep swabbing while (decksRemaining > 0), so I guess I'd better get to it.

    And just like each day was the same, each deck was the same, so that for (var deckNumber = 0; deckNumber < decks.length; deckNumber++) every deck that he was told to do, he just swabbed and swabbed and swabbed. No matter who he complainTo = function(person,rant){...};, the result was always the same: return "Get back to work, " + crewName;.

    In time, he kept his mind occupied by imagining what would happen if (ninjas.decideToAttack()) in the middle of the night.
